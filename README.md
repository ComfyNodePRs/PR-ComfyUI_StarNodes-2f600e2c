- SD(XL) Starter : Is loading checkpoint (with CLIP and VAE) and create an empty latend (you can choose resolutions or set your own)

- FLUX Starter : Is loading Unet (Diffusion Model), 2 Clips and create an empty latend (you can choose resolutions  or set your own)

- SD3.0/3.5 Starter: Is loading Unet (Diffusion Model), 3 Clips and create an empty latend (you can choose resolutions or set your own)

*you can add more ratios if you edit the .json-files in the node folder.

- Input Image Chooser: A simple switch for big workflows to switch between 8 input images 

- Ollama Helper: Is loading your Ollama models from ollamamodels.txt file in the nodes folder and pass it and a system prompt to Ollama nodes.
This helps when ollama models are not show up in the list.
